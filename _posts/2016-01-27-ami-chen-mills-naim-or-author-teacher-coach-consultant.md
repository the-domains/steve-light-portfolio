description: "This is the very simple love of our own 'being-ness' that we may remember from childhood, or in our quietest moments. It is both totally familiar, and totally extraordinary. Along with this deep love comes a deep intelligence, or wisdom, that naturally generates harmony in our seeing and life experience."
